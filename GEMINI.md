# Project Overview

This is an R-based data science project, likely developed for the EC349 course. The project focuses on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, including neural networks, for tasks such as data classification and analysis. Key aspects include data conversion, dataset partitioning, feature evaluation, and model training.

# Building and Running

The primary entry point for this project is `master_script.R`. This script orchestrates the execution of various data processing, feature engineering, and model training steps by sourcing other R scripts.

To run the project:

1.  Ensure you have R and RStudio (or a compatible R environment) installed.
2.  Open the `ec349.Rproj` file in RStudio to set the working directory correctly.
3.  Run the `master_script.R` file. This can typically be done by opening the file in RStudio and clicking the "Source" button, or by running `source("master_script.R")` in the R console.

The `EC349 u2008071.Rmd` file contains the project report and detailed analysis. To generate the report (e.g., to HTML or PDF), you can "knit" this R Markdown document within RStudio.

# Development Conventions

This project primarily uses R scripts (`.R` files) for code implementation and R Markdown (`.Rmd` files) for reproducible research and reporting. The code generally follows standard R programming practices.
